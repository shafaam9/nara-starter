# CIS 3500: Nara Extension Starter

## Overview
For this project, Shafaa and Andrea contributed to the Nara Extension Starter by implementing the following features:

1. Rotating Weekly Challenge (Shafaa)

- Added a ‚ÄúWeekly Challenge‚Äù module that selects a new mini‚Äëchallenge each Monday from a configurable list (e.g. ‚ÄúDrink 8 glasses of water,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake a 10‚Äëminute walk‚Äù).

- Integrated checkboxes next to each challenge so users can mark progress alongside their normal tasks.

- Persisted completion state in Chrome storage and automatically resets the challenge at the start of each week.

2. Inspirational Quote Overlay (Shafaa)

- Created a New¬†Tab override that displays a randomly chosen inspirational quote or affirmation on every tab load.

- Styled the overlay to be lightweight and unobtrusive (opacity, font size, positioning).

3. Speech Bubble Encouragement (Andrea)

- Implemented a feature such that whenever a user has completed their task, a thought bubble appears with encouraging message
  
- Designed the feature to bubble up slightly and disappear after a few seconds.

4. Mood Selection Prompt (Andrea)

- Designed a mood selection feature that allows users to choose a mood that they align with in order to store their emotional state

## Project Description
Nara is a Chrome extension that helps users manage their tasks and reminders efficiently. Your task is to enhance this extension by implementing new features.

## Enhancement Options
Choose one of the following enhancements to implement:

1. **Speech Bubble Encouragement**: Implement a feature where, whenever the user checks off a task, a speech or thought bubble appears near the deer with a short, encouraging message (e.g., ‚ÄúGreat job!‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making progress!‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep going!‚Äù).
2. **Daily Gratitude Log**: Implement a small text area where users can note one thing they‚Äôre grateful for each day. Over time, they can revisit a dedicated ‚Äúgratitude log‚Äù to see their positive moments. Provide an interesting method to save these entries and display them on a separate screen so users can easily access their past entries.
3. **Mood Selection Prompt**: Implement a simple mood selection feature(e.g., happy, stressed, neutral) with a small icon or emoji. This allows users to log their emotional state quickly each day.
4. **Rotating Weekly Challenge**: Implement a weekly challenge system‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúDrink 8 glasses of water each day‚Äù or ‚ÄúTake a 10-minute walk daily.‚Äù Users can check off these mini-challenges alongside their normal tasks for extra motivation.
5. **Inspirational Quote Overlay**: Implement a short inspirational quote or positive affirmation that appears on each new tab, displayed in a subtle text overlay.
6. **Implement a History Feature**: Maintain a log of all tasks and reminders created by the user, allowing them to revisit past items and track progress over time.
7. **Custom Feature**: Propose a unique feature (requires instructor/TA approval).
